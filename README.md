# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website ([taranglasson.com](https://www.taranglasson.com/)), built with modern web technologies. It replaces my previous Squarespace-hosted website to save costs and improve customisability. It is deployed and hosted for free using **Vercel** with **Cloudflare** for domain & DNS management.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) with MDX
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Vercel
- **Domain & DNS Management:** Cloudflare
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the local development server

## 🔄 Updating the Website

### Pulling the latest changes from GitHub
```sh
git pull origin main
```

### Committing and pushing changes
1. Stage your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit with a message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:

   ```

## 🌍 Hosting & Deployment

- The website is hosted and deployed via **Vercel**. **Vercel** handles both the deployment of your site and the automatic updates when changes are pushed to GitHub.
- The domain is managed via **Cloudflare**. **Cloudflare** handles the DNS configuration, including routing traffic to Vercel.
- Additional domains (`taranglasson.co`, `.net`, `.xyz`, `.me`) are redirected to `taranglasson.com`.

## 🔥 Features & Customizations
- **Typography:** Uses **Cal Sans** font for a clean and modern look.
- **Dark Mode Support** (optional if implemented)
- **SEO Optimized** with Next.js best practices

## 🛑 Disabling the Old Squarespace Website
To fully migrate, I **transferred my domain from Squarespace to Cloudflare**.

## 🎯 Possible Improvements
- Enhancing animations and hover effects
- Adding interactive elements for better engagement
- Improving blog post formatting with MDX enhancements (if relevant)
